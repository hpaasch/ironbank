From Monday night:
--------------------
Implements Normal Mode of assignment. Leaving the ability to block an overdraw until
Tuesday's work, because that would dealt with during the form handling, which is beyond
the scope of tonight's work.

This is a basic bank register application in which the customer creates an account with
secure access, and enters credit and debit transactions. The account view shows the
account number, summary of transactions from the past 30 days and an overall current
balance. The customer then can click on a transaction to see more. The additional
details include a timestamp and a note.

A non-customer can either make an account or not use the application.

For tonight's Part One, transactions were entered through the admin interface.
